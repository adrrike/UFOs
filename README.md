# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage for Dana with a dynamic table to allow for easy in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by filtering multiple criteria at the same time. 


## Results: 

By just typing in the conditions to filter and hitting enter the table will update displaying only events that fit all criteria. 

- insert image1

Any researcher could use the filter function to filter states where potential UFO events occured. 

- insert image2

Any researcher could use the filter function to filter shapes associated with UFO events. 

- insert image3

Any researcher could use the filter function to filter multiple criteria associated with UFO events for their research. 



## Summary:

One drawback of this webpage 
- The single landing page makes it look cluttered, and clunky to navigate:

Two additional recommendations for further development:
- Create multiple pages branching out from the homepage for a more organized and better viewing experience. 
- Utilize a data input method(API or Webscrape) to consistently update the data as more UFO sightings take place.
