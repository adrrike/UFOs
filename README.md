# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage for Dana with a dynamic table to allow for easy in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by filtering multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results: 

By just typing in the conditions to filter and hitting enter the table will update displaying only events that fit all criteria.

Any researcher could use the filter function to filter multiple criteria associated with UFO events for their research. 


## Summary:

One drawback of this webpage 
- The single landing page makes it look cluttered, and clunky to navigate.

Two additional recommendations for further development:
- Create multiple pages branching out from the homepage for a more organized and better viewing experience. 
- Utilize a data input method(API or Webscrape) to consistently update the data as more UFO sightings take place.
